# Uploading to an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="data-prep-upload-s3"></a>

 After you format your historical input data \(see [Formatting Your Input Data](data-prep-formatting.md)\), you must upload the CSV file to an Amazon S3 bucket and give Amazon Personalize permission to access to your Amazon S3 resources: 

1. Upload your CSV files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \( Amazon S3\) bucket\. This is the location that Amazon Personalize imports your data from\. For more information, see [Uploading Files and Folders by Using Drag and Drop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/upload-objects.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide\.

1. Give Amazon Personalize access to your Amazon S3 resources by attaching access policies to your Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon Personalize role\. See [Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources](#granting-personalize-s3-access)\.

After you upload your data to an Amazon S3 bucket and give Amazon Personalize access to Amazon S3, import your data into Amazon Personalize\. For more information\. See [ Step 3: Importing Your Data](data-prep-importing.md)\.

## Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources<a name="granting-personalize-s3-access"></a>

To give Amazon Personalize access to your Amazon S3 bucket, do the following:

1.  Attach a policy to the Amazon Personalize service role \(see [Creating an IAM Role for Amazon Personalize](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions)\) that allows access to your Amazon S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon S3 Policy to the Amazon Personalize Service Role](#attaching-s3-policy-to-role)\. 

1.  Attach a bucket policy to the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data files so Amazon Personalize can access them\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon Personalize Access Policy to Your S3 Bucket](#attach-bucket-policy)\. 

**Note**  
Because Amazon Personalize doesnâ€™t communicate with AWS VPCs, Amazon Personalize can't interact with Amazon S3 buckets that allow only VPC access\.

### Attaching an Amazon S3 Policy to the Amazon Personalize Service Role<a name="attaching-s3-policy-to-role"></a>

To attach an Amazon S3 policy to your Amazon Personalize role do the following:

1. Sign in to the IAM console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)\)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**, and choose **Create policy**\.

1. Choose the JSON tab, and update the policy as follows\. Replace `bucket-name` with the name of your bucket\. If you are using a batch workflow, Amazon Personalize needs additional permissions\. See [Amazon S3 Policy for Batch Workflows](#role-policy-for-batch-workflows)\. 

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Id": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. For **Name**, enter `PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy`\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter a short sentence describing this policy, for example, **Allow Amazon Personalize to access its S3 bucket\.**

1. Choose **Create policy**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and choose the role you created for Amazon Personalize\. See [Creating an IAM Role for Amazon Personalize](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions)\.

1. For **Permissions**, choose **Attach policies**\.

1. To display the policy in the list, type part of the policy name in the **Filter policies** filter box\.

1. Choose the check box next to the policy you created earlier in this procedure\.

1. Choose **Attach policy**\.

   Before your role is ready for use with Amazon Personalize you must also attach a bucket policy to the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data\. See [Attaching an Amazon Personalize Access Policy to Your S3 Bucket](#attach-bucket-policy)\.
