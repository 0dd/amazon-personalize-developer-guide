# Types of data you can import into Amazon Personalize<a name="data"></a>

 The following topics introduce the different types of data that you can import into Amazon Personalize Interactions, Users, and Items datasets\. 

Each type of dataset has different data requirements depending on the domain you choose for your Domain dataset group or if you instead create Custom dataset group\. If you aren't sure what type of data you need, we recommend creating a Domain dataset group and using the default schemas for your domain as a guide\. For more information about dataset and schema requirements see [Datasets and schemas](how-it-works-dataset-schema.md)\.
