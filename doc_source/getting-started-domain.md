# Getting started with a Domain dataset group<a name="getting-started-domain"></a>

 This getting started guide shows you how to create a Domain dataset group and domain resources with either the Amazon Personalize console or APIs with Jupyter \(iPython\) notebooks\. You create Domain dataset group for the VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND domain, import interactions data, and create and use recommenders for VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND use cases to get personalized movie recommendations\.

## Getting started with a Domain dataset group using Amazon Personalize APIs with Jupyter \(iPython\) notebooks<a name="gs-jupyter-notebook-doomain"></a>

 To get started using Amazon Personalize using Jupyter notebooks, clone or download a series of notebooks found in the [getting\_started](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/tree/master/getting_started) folder of the [Amazon Personalize samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples) repository\. The notebooks walk you through importing training data, creating a recommender, and getting recommendations with Amazon Personalize\.

**Note**  
 Before starting with the notebooks, make sure to build your environment following the steps in the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/blob/master/getting_started/README.md)
