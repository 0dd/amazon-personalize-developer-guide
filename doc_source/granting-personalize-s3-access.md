# Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources<a name="granting-personalize-s3-access"></a>

To give Amazon Personalize access to your Amazon S3 bucket, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, follow the steps in [Setting Up Permissions](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md) to set up permissions so your IAM users can access Amazon Personalize and Amazon Personalize can access your resources\.

1.  Attach a policy to the Amazon Personalize service role \(see [Creating an IAM Role for Amazon Personalize](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions)\) that allows access to your Amazon S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon S3 Policy to the Amazon Personalize Service Role](#attaching-s3-policy-to-role)\. 

1.  Attach a bucket policy to the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data files so Amazon Personalize can access them\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon Personalize Access Policy to Your S3 Bucket](#attach-bucket-policy)\. 

1. If you are using AWS KMS for encryption, give your Amazon Personalize service role permission to use your key\. For more information see [Using key policies in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\. 

**Note**  
Because Amazon Personalize doesnâ€™t communicate with AWS VPCs, Amazon Personalize can't interact with Amazon S3 buckets that allow only VPC access\.
