# How it works<a name="how-it-works"></a>

 Amazon Personalize uses your data to train a custom recommendation model and deploy a recommendation API\. You use this API in your application to request real\-time recommendations, which Amazon Personalize generates with your custom model\. Amazon Personalize also supports batch workflows for use cases that don't require recommendations in real time, such as personalized marketing emails\.
