# Contextual Metadata<a name="interactions-contextual-metadata"></a>

Interactions datasets can store contextual information for use in training\. Contextual metadata is interactions data you collect on the user's environment at the time of an event\. Including contextual metadata allows you to provide a more personalized experience for existing users\. For example, if customers shop differently when accessing your catalog from a phone compared to a computer, include contextual metadata about the user's device\. Recommendations will then be more relevant based on how they are browsing\. 

 Additionally, contextual metadata helps decrease the cold\-start phase for new or unidentified users\. The cold\-start phase refers to the period when your recommendation engine provides less relevant recommendations due to the lack of historical information regarding that user\.
